<h1>About the app</h1>
<p class="lead"> Do you look for great content on Twitter? Are you sometimes completely overwhelmed by the amount of Tweets, and you ask yourself: Do I need to read all of these Tweets? Do I need to click all of these links? Do I care about all the #s, @s, RTs? Should I even read the Tweet or is it a part of a conversation? If you do, then popular-now is for you! </p>

<p> We measure Tweet popularity with a relative number of re-tweets. A popular Tweet is a Tweet which number of re-tweets is higher than the average number of re-tweets per tweet for a given author. Think about it this way, tweets of popular authors (those with many followers) will receive on average more re-tweets per each of their Tweet than less popular authors. An absolute number of re-tweets only tells us about a popularity of an author and not necessarily about a popularity of a Tweet itself. Therefore we think popular Tweets are Tweets that are highly popular for given author, that is collected more re-tweets that the author gets on average. </p>


<h3> Features and feature selection </h3>
I created a number of features describing each Tweet and its author.

<h3> Things I tried </h3>
<p> I tried two classification models, Random Forest and Naive Bayes, each of them doing independent prediction on different features of the test set. </p>

<h3> Performance </h3>
Random Forest has an AUC of 0.77, Naive Bayes has AUC 0.69 If I only use both classifications and classify a Tweet as popular only if both models predict it to be such, I get AUC 0.59.

<h3>Other things to take into account</h3>
Maybe one should make a model for each author individually to predict its important tweets based on its audience?
Maybe one should narrow down topic.
In Naive Bayes use less words as features? Only the most frequent words?
Increase the training set? Or train only based on more recent tweets?

<h3>To Do</h3>
Divide it in three categories, look, model, experience
Add social icons?
Take into account what is at the end of the link, title of an article? Use goose?
Link wrapping - see what is on the other side
model is doing very bad for celebrities and sports. could be because different authors - news outlets and celebrities themselves chosen quite on random. Another possibility is that the text is very important in other categories! 
One more thing to add is trend words/#tags if they appear in text.
Build a model for favorite tweets, different than the re-tweeted
Past research on that
What is new - topic selection and popularity definition
look at target of links
look at source of tweet
look at hash tag trends in recent tweets


<h3>Trouble</h3>
Install latest version of Tweepy. Install a hack to mysql-python otherwise it doesn't unicode characters!
